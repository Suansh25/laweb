            <h2>About Telangana</h2>
            <p>‘South of North and North of South,’ Telangana has long been a meeting place for diverse languages and
                cultures. It is easily the best example for India’s composite culture, pluralism and inclusiveness.
                Located
                on the uplands of Deccan plateau, Telangana is the link between the North and South of India. It is thus
                no
                surprise that the region on the whole came to be known for its Ganga-Jamuna Tehzeeb and the capital
                Hyderabad as a ‘miniature India!’.Geography, Polity and Economy of the region determined the culture of
                Telangana.</p>

        <div class="geo">

            Satavahanas, the earliest
            known rulers of the region sowed the seeds of independent and self-sufficient village economy, the relics of
            which can be felt even today. In the medieval times, the Kakatiya dynasty’s rule, between the 11th and 14th
            centuries with Warangal as their capital, and subsequently the Qutub Shahis and Asafjahis, who ruled the
            Hyderabad state defined the culture of the region
            Telangana is a culturally rich state in India with a diverse linguistic landscape. The official language of
            Telangana is Telugu, spoken by about 76% of the population12Urdu is the second official language, spoken by
            around 12% of the people.</div>
        <br><br>
        In addition to these, Hindi is also widely spoken. The state is home to several tribal communities, each
        with their own languages, such as Gondi, Kolami, Lambadi, Chenchu, and Koya.

        <p>Telangana, a state in southern India, is a vibrant tapestry of linguistic diversity. The official language is Telugu, spoken by about 76% of the population1. Telugu, with its rich literary heritage, has several dialects within the state, reflecting regional variations2. Urdu is the second official language, spoken by around 12% of the population1. Historically, Urdu was the official language of the Hyderabad State before 1948, and it remains widely used, especially in Hyderabad1.

            In addition to Telugu and Urdu, Telangana is home to several tribal languages, including Gondi, Lambadi, and Kolami3. These languages are spoken by various indigenous communities, each with its own unique cultural and linguistic traditions3. Hindi and English are also commonly spoken, particularly in urban areas3.
            
            The linguistic landscape of Telangana is a reflection of its historical and cultural amalgamation. The region’s history of diverse rulers, including the Satavahanas, Kakatiyas, Qutub Shahis, and Asaf Jahis, has contributed to its rich cultural and linguistic heritage
