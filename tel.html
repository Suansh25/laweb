            <p>‘South of North and North of South,’ Telangana has long been a meeting place for diverse languages and cultures. It is easily the best example for India’s composite culture, pluralism and inclusiveness. Located on the uplands of Deccan plateau, Telangana is the link between the North and South of India. It is thus no surprise that the region on the whole came to be known for its Ganga-Jamuna Tehzeeb and the capital Hyderabad as a ‘miniature India!’.
 <br><br>
                Geography, Polity and Economy of the region determined the culture of Telangana. Satavahanas, the earliest known rulers of the region sowed the seeds of independent and self-sufficient village economy, the relics of which can be felt even today. In the medieval times, the Kakatiya dynasty’s rule, between the 11th and 14th centuries with Warangal as their capital, and subsequently the Qutub Shahis and Asafjahis, who ruled the Hyderabad state defined the culture of the region
                Telangana is a culturally rich state in India with a diverse linguistic landscape. The official language of Telangana is Telugu, spoken by about 76% of the population12Urdu is the second official language, spoken by around 12% of the people.
<br><br>
                In addition to these, Hindi is also widely spoken. The state is home to several tribal communities, each with their own languages, such as Gondi, Kolami, Lambadi, Chenchu, and Koya</p>
